# Retweet Prediction for SPEIT Deep Learning

To use the project, download 'train.csv' from the project source https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dl-speit-retweet-prediction/data

Run the train.py script to train the model.
Run predict.py to predict the number of retweets; by default it uses final_model.keras, but best_151.keras is the model used for submission.
The algorithms.py file contains implementations of classical machine learning methods.

# Retweet Prediction for SPEIT Deep Learning

This branch implements a linear model 'MLP' and a transformer based model 'transformer'. 
- The linear model just uses the numerical values provided by the datasets (followers number, etc)
- The transformer model processes the text data through a single transformer layer and outputs a "
